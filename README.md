Geome
=====

A Real-time mapping application for Android. It's kinda like GroupMe and Maps had a baby. Hence the name Geo-me! **see what I did there

Note by the author: This was actually a huge undertaking on my part during the Summer of 2013. 

You can see that I created a very structured and intricate application that had to leverage GPS in Froyo level applications

while still conserving battery life.

The idea of the app to make a social mapping application. Where you and your family/friends can all

see where the other is in real-time (as long as you stay connected). Some uses for this app include:

-Finding a friend at a concert
-Knowing when your husband will arrive home
-Watching your kids get to school safely
-Locating others when no landmarks are visible

You can see all my classes inside src

All resources in res

Everything else, libs

(Note: I could no longer afford to pay MongoLab for servers, so all Mongo related code will throw a 
username error when trying to login. Just replace my username with yours.)
